To install allmon 
make sure you have sudo privilages first..
sudo su ie etc..
Some of the below may not be needed yet.
apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt

After installing apache
nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
file may be labeled differently if so cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
ls # to display the files in the folder
I use nano to edit files example nano default.conf
the file should look similar to this..

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

Edit the above to match the folder where you plan to put your allmon installation.
example /var/www/almon

crtl x to save and exit

Now you need to change directories back to your public folder.
cd /var/www/
ls
chmod 755 -R ./*
This allows public permission for the site.
if you put your files in /allmon cd to /var/www/allmon
Make sure you edit your password fields in login.php
Here is an example of the top half of the file..
Where PASSWORD1 and PASSWORD2 is please change these to reflect the password you wish to use.

<?php
session_start();

$oun = $_POST['user'];
$opw = $_POST['passwd'];

if (($oun=='admin') AND (($opw=='PASSWORD1') OR ($opw=='PASSWORD2'))) {
    print "Login succeeded.";
    $_SESSION['loggedin'] = true;
} else {
    print "Sorry, login failed.";
die;



Now you need to make sure asterisk will talk with your allmon page.
cd /etc/asterisk/
nano manager.conf

Where it says this.

[general]
displaysystemname = yes
enabled = yes
;webenabled = yes
port = 5038

Make it say this

[general]
displaysystemname = yes
enabled = yes
webenabled = yes
port = 5038

Adjust the below to how ever you need to configure your system..

This is a rough sample of how mine looks with the 
exception of password and bindaddr= either ip address or 0.0.0.0 if not local

bindaddr = 127.0.0.1   ; Local interface only! 
displayconnects = yes
;
; Add a Unix epoch timestamp to events (not action responses)
;
timestampevents = yes

[admin]
secret = PutaPasswordHere
read = all,system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user,config
write = all,system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user,config

#ctrl x to save and exit

Now that we are back to commandline cd /var/www/allmon
cp allmon.ini.txt allmon.ini.php
cp controlpanel.ini.txt controlpanel.ini.php

Now edit allmon.ini.php
nano allmon.ini.php
Match up the infromation to your asterisk installation then ctrl x to exit and save


You need to make astdb.php +rwx so this is the command to do this
chmod +rwx ./astdb.php

generally i run it the first time manually by typing 
./astdb.php

if you ls -l 
you should see a new txt file that the above command populated.

I generally run this every 30 minutes in crontab -e
Generally i use option 1 nano to edit files while in crontab -e
it will look similar to this
*/30 * * * * ./var/www/allmon/astdb.php

#ctrl x to save
hope this helps with the installation of allmon.
